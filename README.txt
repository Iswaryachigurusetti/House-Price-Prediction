House Price Prediction

Project Overview:
A machine learning project to predict house prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.
Uses Linear Regression to build the predictive model.

Key Features:
- Preprocesses and cleans data
- Uses Linear Regression for predictions
- Evaluates performance using Mean Squared Error and R2 Score
- Visualizes Actual vs Predicted prices
- Allows testing on new houses with custom features

Technologies Used:
Python | Pandas | scikit-learn | Matplotlib | Seaborn

Dataset:
CSV file with columns: 'area', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'price'
Example:
2500, 4, 3, 500000


Usage:
- See model performance metrics (MSE, R2 Score)
- Visualize Actual vs Predicted house prices
- Predict prices for new houses by changing the 'new_house' variable
